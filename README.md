# gas-(and-gas-cost)-estimation-of-solidity-contracts
This repo contains a series of Python scripts for estimating gas (and gas cost) of Solidity contracts.

### Prerequisites

> Software
	* We recommend [Python 3] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) which is needed to execute 'installer.py' and 'main.py'; Other versions of Python should work, however for the best compatibility Python 3 is highly recommended.
